# Rock Paper Scissors
This repo showcases a simple Rock Paper Scissors multiplayer game utilizing JavaScript with Node.js to be played in a web browser. It was built after following omgimanerd's "How To Build A Multiplayer Browser Game" template for a class assignment. After following that tutorial, Juriy's YouTube video series starting with "Building multiplayer game with JavaScript" was found and also helped in the construction of this project. This project is meant for educational purposes.

In order to run, make sure express and socket.io are installed in the server folder, as well as npm init. Two browsers can be open to observe the functionality. The server can be run on port 5000: http://localhost:5000/
