# Rock Paper Scissors
This repo showcases a simple Rock Paper Scissors multiplayer game utilizing JavaScript with Node.js to be played in a web browser. It was built after following omgimanerd's "How To Build A Multiplayer Browser Game" template for a class assignment. After following that tutorial, Juriy's YouTube video series starting with "Building multiplayer game with JavaScript" was found and also helped in the construction of this project. This project is meant for educational purposes.

# Software Quality Testing
Expanding on this project, I have included some unit tests for some of the functions using the jest framework.

# How to run locally
In the Command Prompt, first you must initialize the project with `npm init`.
Install Express.js, socket.io, and jest with `npm install express socket.io jest`.
Then run program with `npm start` in the server directory.
Two browsers can be open to observe the 2-player functionality with an interactive chat. The server can be run on port 5000: http://localhost:5000/
